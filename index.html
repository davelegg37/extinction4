              To quote Pogo we have met the enemy and he is us. We are the sixth extinction and that extinction includes us. Words like us, he, we, they, allow us to avoid individual action by transferring responsibility for our actions to a collective they. “I’m innocent your Honor, It's Society's fault not mine” , doesn't work in a court of law and it won't in mother nature's court. When a species habitat deteriorates  so does the species. And when the  polar bear, bee, and tree go extinct so does their habitat and so do we. Extinction in the aprocene is caused by habitat destruction not comets.

The purpose of these  games is to place you in the driver's seat instead of “they”. So who killed cock robin or the polar bear? You did.
How to play the gameThe game consists of six games.  The goal of each of the games is to help the species escape the red extinction box in which it is trapped. You  do this by choosing individual actions you can take that will help save its habitat. Each species's habitat is different so things you do to help a polar bear probably won’t save a bee, or a tree. Some things you do are much more effective than others. Each time you act costs you resources some more than others. The game ends when you run out of resources. There are six species you can try and save, polar bears, bees, and trees. You choose which one to try and save at the beginning of the game.

Each species's habitat is different so things you do to help a polar bear probably won’t save a frog, or a tree. Some things you do are much more effective than others. Each time you act costs you effort, some more than others. You get three rounds to save your animal. The game ends when you exceed your fail to save or save a species or run out of resources. There are three species you can try and save, polar bears, bees, and trees. You choose which one at the beginning of the game.
